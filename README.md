### Key Components

- `pkg/speckle`: Overall Client SDK
- `pkg/speckle_automate`: The core functionality for creating and running Speckle Automate functions.
- `pkg/objects`: Defines Speckle object types and interfaces.

## Usage

To create a Speckle Automate function:

1. Define your function inputs:

```go
type FunctionInputs struct {
    Param1 string `json:"param1" validate:"required"`
    Param2 int    `json:"param2"`
}
```
2. Implement your function logic:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "github.com/specklesystems/speckle-go/pkg/automate"
  )
  
  func main() {
      automate.Run(automate.Function{
          Inputs: FunctionInputs{},
          Run: func(ctx *automate.Context[FunctionInputs]) error {
              // Your function logic here
              return nil
          },
      })
  }
```
